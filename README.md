# Hackathon Ice Cream Shop - Geladinhos Felizes

This is a project made during the 24-hour Hackathon, where I and my colleagues Diogo Carvalho, Luis Reis, Rui Godinho and Valter Oliveira created a website for a fictional ice cream shop called Geladinhos Felizes. 
The website features the shop’s menu, the daily promotions, the testimonials from customers and a contact form. 
The goal of this project was to practice our skills in HTML, CSS and JS and create a responsive and attractive website.
